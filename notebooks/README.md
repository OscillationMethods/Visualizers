# Oscillations Visualizers

This folder contains the notebooks & code that create the oscillation visualization gifs.

Each visualization is created by a dedicated notebook. 
The code in this repository creates all the images needed for the gifs, 
but the gifs need to be stitched together, which is currently done with an external service.

Note that each of the visualizations is an animated version of one of the figures from the 
[paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejn.15361).
The original code that these animations are based on is available in the 
[project repository](https://github.com/OscillationMethods/OscillationMethods).

## Notebooks

The current list of notebooks:

### f0 - Oscillations Introduction

Notebook to create a introductory visualization showing oscillations, with the time series, filtered trace, and power spectrum.

### f1 - Oscillation Presence

Notebook to create a visualization showing illustory oscillations, whereby filtered aperiodic activity can look rhythmic.

### f2 - Center Frequency

Notebook to create a visualization showing how variable center frequency can impact measures.

### f3 - Aperiodic Activity

Notebook to create a visualization showing how dynamic aperiodic activity can impact measures.

### f4 - Temporal Variability

Notebook to create a visualization showing how temporal variability (burstiness) can impact measures.

### f5 - Waveform Shape

Notebook to create a visualization showing how waveform shape can impact measures.

### f6 - Overlapping Sources

Notebook to create a visualization showing how overlapping sources can lead to different results at a recording electrode.

### f7 - Signal-to-noise Ratio

Notebook to create a visualization showing how variable signal-to-noise ratio can impact measures.
