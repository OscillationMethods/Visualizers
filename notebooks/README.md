# Oscillations Visualizers: Notebooks

This folder contains the notebooks & code that create the oscillation visualization gifs.

### f0 - Oscillations Introduction

Notebook to create a introductory visualization showing oscillations, with the time series, filtered trace, and power spectrum.

### f1 - Oscillation Presence

Notebook to create a visualization showing illustory oscillations, whereby filtered aperiodic activity can look rhythmic.

### f2 - Center Frequency

Notebook to create a visualization showing how variable center frequency can impact measures.

### f3 - Aperiodic Activity

Notebook to create a visualization showing how dynamic aperiodic activity can impact measures.

### f4 - Temporal Variability

Notebook to create a visualization showing how temporal variability (burstiness) can impact measures.

### f5 - Waveform Shape

Notebook to create a visualization showing how waveform shape can impact measures.

### f6 - Overlapping Sources

Notebook to create a visualization showing how overlapping sources can lead to different results at a recording electrode.

### f7 - Signal-to-noise Ratio

Notebook to create a visualization showing how variable signal-to-noise ratio can impact measures.
