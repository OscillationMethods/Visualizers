## Overview

This repository includes the code to create the animated visualization, as well as copies of the final outputs. 

The animated visualizers, with descriptions, are also available on the 
[vizualizations page](https://oscillationmethods.github.io/docs/viz.html)
of the project website.

## ReUse

Copies of the animated visualizations are available in the `gifs/` folder. 
These visualization are available for re-use under a Creative Commons 
[CC-BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) 
license, meaning all non-commercial purposes are fine. 

The code to create these visualizations is available in the `notebooks/` folder, under the
[MIT License](https://github.com/OscillationMethods/Visualizers/blob/main/notebooks/LICENSE), 
meaning if you wish to use and adapt this code, you may do so. 

If you re-use these animations and/or the code, please cite the associated paper.
