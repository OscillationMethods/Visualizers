# OscMethods: Animated Visualizers

This repository contains animated visualizations for the OscillationMethods project, as well as the code that creates them. 

## Overview

Each visualization is created by a dedicated notebook. Note that the code in this repository creates all the images needed for the gifs, but that the gifs need to be stitched together, which is currently done with an external service. 

## Gifs
